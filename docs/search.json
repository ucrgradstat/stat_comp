Additionally, we will certainly give you credit for your work. Just follow the guidelines below and send us an email to ucr.grad.stat@gmail.com. With your help, this website will benefit everyone.\n\nGuidelines\nYou are welcome to create the tutorial in any way you want.

You may also submit an R Markdown file and we will knit the document into an html file.\nIf you choose to provide data for your tutorial, please make sure the that data is publicly available. We recommend that you simulate your own data to prevent any issues. Additionally, the smaller the data set, the better.\nYou may also submit a YouTube video for your tutorial. All you need to do is provide the link to your video.\nLastly, make sure you cite any work you use.\nIf you need any help, please feel free to email us at ucr.grad.stat@gmail.com.\n\n\nRemoving A Tutorial\nIf you wish to no longer have your tutorial on this website, please email us and we will gladly remove it."
