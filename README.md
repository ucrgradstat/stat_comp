# Statistical Computing Website Repository

This Repository contains all the files to construct the website: [ucrgradstat.github.io/stat_comp/](https://ucrgradstat.github.io/stat_comp/)

## Building the Website

The website is a collection of R Markdown files

## Website Documents

Other than the README.md file and tutorials, all the pages with this website were constructed with R Markdown Files.  The three components the R Markdown files needed in the yaml header were the "title", "description", and "site". The "description" line is needed to make the document searchable. The "site" line must follow what is below:

```
site: distill:distill_website
```

## Tutorials

The tutorials can be any format. However, to host it on the website, an html file is needed. If students submit an R Markdown file, compile it and use the html file.
